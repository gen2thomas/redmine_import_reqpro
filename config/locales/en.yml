This will generate some xml files including all the needed informations to import later on inside Requisite Pro or even in redmine by using this ReqPro Importer. ReqPro Importer guide you to the import process. Along the next pages nothing will be imported until on the last page the 'import button' was pressed. All the configuration informations will be hold in the memory. Therefore you can cancel the process at any time without manipulating something else in your database."
